CSC 440 AI - Poker Playing Agent

A poker playing agent written in python.

Heads up no-limit texas hold-em. Two player only.

Requires Python 2.7 and the Deuces poker eval library.

You can get Python for your environment from python.org

After you have python installed and added to your path, you can install deuces using this command from cmd or powershell.
python -m pip install deuces (Windows) or just
pip install deuces (Linux)

This project is written in 100% pure python as is deuces. It may initially lag on startup in order to load in the qtable, but should run fine after that.

5/1/2017 - Officially, the project is complete. There will be no more changes to it from here on out.
